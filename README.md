## Hooked

![hooked] (public/hooked.png)

A Hangman lyric game. Guess the missing word to complete the lyric.

Hooked - A play on song hooks and being "hooked" on a game.

I created this game when I first learned how to code. At the time I was really hooked on Never mind the Buzzcocks. Inspired by the show I created this hangman game where you have to guess the missing word from the lyric.

I initally built it using plain jquery and hosted on Heroku. It was never fully functional so six years later I have rebuilt it using Vite and React adding some extra functionality which back then I just wasnt sure how.

The styles have remained the same so I remember exactly how it looked like initially.

###To do:

- Split things out into multiple components 
- Add tests.
